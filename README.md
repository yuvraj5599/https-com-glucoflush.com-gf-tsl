Glucoflush is a revolutionary new blood sugar control supplement that helps you control your blood sugar levels better.

According to the manufacturer, Glucoflush is the first supplement of its’ kind to address what it claims is the root cause of type 2 diabetes. By taking the supplement daily, you can control your cravings for carbs and sugar, prevent blood sugar spikes, and better manage your blood sugar levels on a consistent basis.

What Exactly is Glucoflush?

As previously mentioned, Glucoflush is an all-natural supplement that was developed to help you manage your blood sugar levels. It comes in the form of a liquid tincture, which is comprised of several natural, GMO-free, and organic ingredients.
To better control your blood sugar levels, simply fill the dropper to the top on a daily basis. Then, add the product to your favorite beverage, such as orange juice, tea, or water. The powerful ingredients will be quickly absorbed by your gut and start eliminating parasites to better help you manage your blood sugar levels.


How Glucoflush Works

According to the official website, Glucoflush addresses the root cause of type 2 diabetes, which has only recently been discovered.

Despite what we previously thought, the root cause of diabetes is because of microorganisms found in our water supply. These organisms cause cravings for sugar and carbohydrates all the time, which in turn leads to abnormally high blood sugar levels.
This is why Glucoflush contains some of the most powerful anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and powerful polyphenol compounds that kill these microorganisms, preventing them from wreaking havoc on your blood sugar levels.

 

In addition, Glucoflush supports healthier blood sugar levels by reducing your insulin resistance, improving blood glucose uptake, and improving the health of your pancreas. All three of these bodily functions are essential to blood sugar control and will further help your goals of getting your blood sugar levels under control.

 

Ingredients in Glucoflush

There are 11 high quality herbal extracts in Glucoflush, all of which are designed to support your blood sugar control in various ways.
Here are the eleven ingredients in Glucoflush:

 

Fennel seed: Fennel seeds support blood sugar levels because of their high concentration of vitamin C and potassium.

Fennel seed may also suppress your food cravings, improve digestion, regulate blood pressure levels, purify your blood, and aid in weight loss.

 

Marshmallow root: Marshmallow root is a perennial herb native to Europe. It is primarily used to support digestion, improve blood pressure, for pain relief, to heal wounds, and for its anti-inflammatory benefits. It also may support various import bodily functions as well.

 

Black walnut hull: Black walnut hull may help to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels by “burning up” toxins and fatty materials. Eliminating these unhealthy materials may improve your ability to control blood sugar spikes.
Pumpkin seed: Pumpkin seed is rich in antioxidants and has been linked to a reduced risk of certain cancers. It also has been shown to improve heart health and reduce blood sugar levels potentially because of its’ rich source of magnesium. More research between the connection is needed though.

 

Wormwood herb: Wormwood may be beneficial to balance blood sugar levels and to improve insulin production. Some research suggests that wormwood bark may also prevent the accumulation of lipids in the blood and reduce blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. It can also be used to treat Crohn’s disease and to relieve parasitic infections in the gut.

 

Slippery Elm Bark: Slippery elm bark has been used to treat wounds, boils, ulcers, and bacterial infections for centuries. It may also support healthier digestion, relieve diarrhea, and improve immunity. Studies have also found slippery elm can reduce blood sugar levels, although the exact mechanism isn’t entirely known.

Clove bud: Clove bud contains polyphenol compounds that may reduce after meal blood sugar levels. In fact, one study found clove extract lowered after meal blood sugar levels by 21.5% in healthy adults and 27.2% in prediabetics. It also helps to improve liver health, bone health, immunity, and may prevent stomach ulcers.

Garlic bulb: Garlic bulb is widely used for overall cardiovascular health. It appears to stabilize blood sugar levels and improve blood sugar management by helping your body better use insulin. Garlic also may improve immunity, has anti-cancer properties, and has antibiotic benefits.

Oregano leaf oil: Oregano leaf contains natural polyphenol compounds that are known to reduce blood sugar levels. It is also rich in antioxidants, has anti-cancer properties, and may help kill bacteria.

 

Peppermint leaf oil: Peppermint leaf has natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, which help your body eliminate unhealthy pathogens. Peppermint also may improve digestion, freshen your breath, and may support healthier blood sugar levels by reducing insulin sensitivity.

 

Papaya seed extract: Studies have found papaya seed extract acts as a powerful antioxidant. It also is beneficial for gut health, helps in weight loss, lowers cholesterol levels, and may have anti-cancer properties. There is some evidence papaya can manage glucose uptake, improving your body’s ability to use glucose to prevent blood sugar spikes.
